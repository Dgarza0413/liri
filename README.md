# liri

we are using axios for the following api's:
- bands in town
- spotify
- ombd
to pull information from the backend and display on the terminal.

This is organized by requiring axios and calling the process.argv to provide certain calls and information


3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
This is primarily a node backend application and requires one to being within the folder of the executed file in order to work. By using the following code: node index.js <parameters>. one is able to provide the instructions to recieve information about a song, band, or movie.

4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning


5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
